## Description

This p5.js project is a simple café ordering simulator. The player makes two choices, drink temperature (hot or cold) and taste preference (sweet or bitter). Selecting these choices involves using on-screen buttons. Based on these selections, the code generates a final drink order. The project demonstrates basic screen navigation, user input handling, and simple UI design.
